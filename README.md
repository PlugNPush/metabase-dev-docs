# metabase-dev-docs

_The literary home for Metabase Clojurians_

This repo has two parts: the `master` branch has a Github action to get the
code from supported projects, generate HTML files with Marginalia, and push it
to this repo's `gh-pages` branch. It runs on a cron job, currently every eight
hours.

The `gh-pages` branch gets automatically deployed to
[metabase-dev-docs.github.io](https://metabase-dev-docs.github.io).
